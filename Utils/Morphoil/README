0. Introduction
---------------------------

Morphoil is used in two steps, mapping and morphing. Mapping is done once before optimization to compute physical-to-logical coordinate mapping, and this mapping information is saved to "mapping.pickled."

The morphing step is done for each sample (experiment) during optimization. Morphing reads a perturbed set of control points and "mapping.pickled" and saves the morphed airfoil to "morphed.dat"


1. Mapping (Initialization)
---------------------------

Usage:

  Morphoil map ControlPoints0.dat Airfoil.dat

"ControlPoints0.dat" contains N-by-M control points of the initial morphing net, where N is the number of control points in the camber-wise direction and M the thickness-wise direction. The format of this file is:

N	M
X00	Y00
X10	Y10
   ...
Xn0	Yn0
X01	Y01
X11	Y11
   ...
Xn1	Yn1
   ...
X0m	Y0m
X1m	Y1m
   ...
Xnm	Ynm

where n = N - 1 and m = M - 1.

"Airfoil.dat" contains a set of two point curves comprising of a suction surface and a pressure surface of an airfoil.

The resulting mapping information is saved into "mapping.pickled."

The mapping procedure also generates a few more files useful in debugging and initializing the control points. The net shape can be conveniently visualized using gnuplot using the follow command.

  plot "ref.dat" index 0:1 with lines, "ref.dat" index 2 with lines, "./net_cp.dat" 


2. Morphing
---------------------------

Usage:

  Morphoil morph ControlPoints.dat mapping.pickled

This morphes the original airfoil onto the net defined by the perturbed control points. The morphed airfoil is saved to "morphed.dat."
